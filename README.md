## About
- The meme generator is a minor project made as the part of the initial learning of the ```react```.  
- Here one can generate any meme and can provie the top and bottom captions to suit according to their own.  

## Motivation 
- Since as mentioned this minor project was the implementation of the primiary react learning phase and as regard to this ```composability``` was more focused rather than ```reusability```
